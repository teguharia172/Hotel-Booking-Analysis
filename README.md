This is my Analysis Toward Hotel Booking Data

# Hotel Booking Demand
This data set contains booking information for a city hotel, a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things.

We found this data set on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand) but the data is originally from the article [Hotel Booking Demand Datasets - ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191) written in journal named [Data in Brief](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/data-in-brief), Volume 22, February 2019. 
The subject area of this data is **hospitality management**. This data was acquired by extraction from hotel's Property Management System (PMS) SQL databases from 2015 to 2017. **Both hotels are located in Portugal**.

Since this is hotel real data, all data elements pertaining hotel or customer identification were deleted. Due to the scarcity of real business data for scientific and educational purposes, these datasets can have an important role for research and education in revenue management, machine learning, as well as in other fields.
